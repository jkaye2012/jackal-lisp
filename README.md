# Jackal

Jackal is a modern Lisp that aims to provide an excellent development and runtime experience
without sacrificing significant performance. The language is primarily functional, but supports
other paradigms where it can without compromising its core design principles.

The language is "interpreted" in that it is meant to run on the Sahara Virtual Machine, but is
also compiled to bytecode before execution. Sahara should eventually provide JIT compilation to
native code in the future for increased performance.
